Marauder's Map README

Madauder's Map, aka C.I.A. (for Content Inventory App), was created in 2011 by Christopher Nash and Michael van den Beuken at Alberta Motor Association. It's a web content inventory system that allows content specialists to find, view, review, comment on and manage their content that's published to the AMA website using OpenText CMS 10. The app will help content specialists with following the content strategy adopted by the Web Content Team in November 2010. It replaces the standard "ginormous shared spreadsheet" method of content inventory with a database-driven model, with page information automatically imported from the live website.

The app rsyncs content from the target folder published to from CMS 10 to the staging server, and uses the metadata from the synced content to populate pages that can be searched, read, and commented on in the Marauder's Map. A cap deploy:update task runs each night to update the content list. Pages are viewable as a list of all live pages, or by section (nav 1), or by publisher. Some additional data is available exclusively to the Marauder's Map version of the content pages, and can be edited/set by the content specialist in this app (deep links, next review date).

Users are created manually, and must me manually added in the future. The content of the app is only viewable to authenticated users. No content is available to anonymous visitors.
